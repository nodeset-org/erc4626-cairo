# ERC4626 inflation attack free

An implementation of ERC4626 in Cairo.

I used the [OZ solidity](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol#L239) implementation. It is itself inspired from YieldBox codebase that has an inflation attack protection. Shares are virtually minted which reduces the issue.

I forked this repo https://github.com/0xK3K/starknet-ERC4626 and improved the codebase with the latest cairo version. Thanks @0xK3K !
